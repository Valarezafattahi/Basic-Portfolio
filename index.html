            Hi,
            <br><br>
            My name is Valareza Fattahi. I'm so excited to show you what I've learned so far in my coding boot-camp as well as my very first website!
            <br><br>
            I have worked as a construction manager for over a decade. I have managed numerous upscale interior wood work projects in Canada. I am also coming from a strong athlete background. I have been professionally playing tennis and snowboard since I was seven and I hold a position of Tennis coach and Snowboarding instructor. 

        </p>
        
        <p class="secondparagraph">
            A few months ago, I decided to initiate a new path in my life and learn coding and web development. I found my self very interested in this field and would like to work as a professional web-developer in the very near future. Further, I am so glad to be part of the <abbr title="University of Toronto"><a id="uoftlink" href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank"><bold>UofT</a></abbr> boot camp community. 

        </p>
        <br>

            Thanks for stopping by and checking out my portfolio and I hope this would be a great academic adventure for everyone.

            <br><br><br>
            Cheers,<br>
            <br>
            Valareza
